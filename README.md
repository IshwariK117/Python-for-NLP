## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand and interpret human language. This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate different NLP techniques and libraries, providing a comprehensive resource for learning and applying NLP methods.

## File Descriptions

### 1_nltk.py

This script introduces the basics of the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library. It covers essential functions for text processing, such as tokenization, stop words removal, and basic text analysis.

### 2_nltk.py

A continuation of `1_nltk.py`, this script delves deeper into nltk functionalities. It explores advanced text processing techniques and demonstrates how to work with larger text corpora.

### 3_stemmer_lemmatization.py

This script focuses on stemming and lemmatization, two important techniques for text normalization in NLP. It compares different stemming algorithms and demonstrates lemmatization using the nltk library.

### 4_pdfReader.py

This script shows how to extract text from PDF files using Python. It utilizes libraries such as PyPDF2 to read PDF documents and preprocess the extracted text for NLP tasks.

### regex.py

This script covers the use of regular expressions (regex) for text processing. It demonstrates how to apply regex for pattern matching, text extraction, and data cleaning in NLP projects.

### stemmer_lemmatization.py

A detailed exploration of stemming and lemmatization, similar to `3_stemmer_lemmatization.py`. This script provides additional examples and comparisons of different approaches to text normalization.

## Getting Started

To get started with the scripts in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your local machine along with the required libraries. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
